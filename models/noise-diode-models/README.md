# Noise Diode Models that are not yet "deployed in the Telescope"

These models are typically constructed from on-sky measurements and evaluated before being deployed formally.
Once deployed formally, the models will be incorporated in the dataset's metadata, so may be removed from this folder.


Filenames follow this pattern: 'rx.%(band).%(serialno).%(pol).csv', e.g. 'rx.l.4.h.csv'.
