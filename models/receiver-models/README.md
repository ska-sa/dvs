## Receiver models that are not yet "deployed in the Telescope"

These models are typically constructed from on-sky measurements and evaluated before being deployed formally.
Once deployed formally, the models will be incorporated in the dataset's metadata, so may be removed from this folder.


**Filenames follow these patterns:**

A. '%(ID)_calculated_noise_%(pol)_chan.dat', e.g. 'RxL_SN004_calculated_noise_H_chan.dat'.

This type of file contains three columns, like 'freqHz, G_dB, Trec'


B. (Deprecated) '%(ID)_calculated_noise.csv', e.g. 'RxL_SN004_calculated_noise.csv'.

This type of file contains three columns, like 'freqHz, TrecH, TrecVK'
