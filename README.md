# Observation-related Scripts
Scripts and resources in this folder are primarily used to capture data, for tests.

Typical examples are:

* Observation scripts, to be executed in a telescope "capture session".
Some of these are specialized variants of [katsdpscripts/observation](https://github.com/ska-sa/katsdpscripts/tree/master/observation)


* Target catalogue files used for observations.
