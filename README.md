# DVS
Observation &amp; reduction tools for the Dish Verification System, as used to implement the test procedures that are described in [321-00001-004 DVS Test Procedures].

The RTS (Receptor Test System) was originally developed by SARAO, for the MeerKAT telescope project. Now revamped as the DVS for the SKA-MID telescope project, this repository re-purposes and expands on the RTS tools and frameworks.

Use of any and all of these resources is governed by the terms of the license agreement!
